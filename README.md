## About

The webskel utility provides skeletons (or "templates") that can give
you a head start with your next web application or service. The concept
is inspired by skeleton directories from the UNIX world - where they can
be the basis for a new user's `${HOME}` directory.

## Examples

**webskel new**

The following example demonstrates how the "new" command can create a
"myapp" directory from the skeleton `@webskel/ruby-graphql-webpack-react`:

   user@localhost$ webskel new @webskel/ruby-graphql-webpack-react myapp

**webskel ls**

The "ls" command provides a list of available skeletons:

   user@localhost webskel ls
